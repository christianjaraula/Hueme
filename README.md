## Description
The mobile application color analysis for different skin tones is designed to help individuals
determine which colors of clothing, make-up, and accessories best enhance their natural
features. The process involves determining the color categories based on their skin tones that
are referred to as seasonal names such as Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, each of
these categories having a different color palette. The user will have to create and log in their
account providing their personal information. The application will request camera permission
to identify which color complements the user’s skin tone. The user will then have the
opportunity to select their skin color, and will be prompted to choose the four color categories
provided by the mobile application.
